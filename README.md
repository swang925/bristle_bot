# Bristle Bot

Bristle Bot is a research project that investigates the dynamics of vibration-driven robots called 'Hexbots'. They are capable of moving in random directions and speeds. It is the mission of the project to understand these movements. We do so via computer vision technique and experimental setup to take videos of their motion and analyze them to get the following parameters.
- size
- postion
- orientation\\
Then, with scripts of names "data processing...", we draw graphs and calculate their translational speed and angular speed.
## Features:
TODO:.py files that takes the input video and search for contours of bristle robot based on the background color and robot color selected
## Requirements:
- OpenCV
- Jupyter Notebook
- Pandas
- Numpy
